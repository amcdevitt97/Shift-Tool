# Shift-Tool

A java program to handle shifts for ciphers.

## Getting Started

I put the whole eclipse project on here, but if you know how to turn Java code into a runnable JAR file, thats pretty much all you need to run this.
The program works best with all caps ciphers and can handle spaces. Any other non A-Z value will be modified too, just a warning.

```
Enter a string: IFMMP XPSME
How many shifts?:
1
Shift Level?:
1
Shift of 0: IFMMP XPSME
Shift of 1: HELLO WORLD
```
This program was made for my Crypto class just to make multiple shifts easier.  Shoutout to Professor "NSA-Man" Bauer.
